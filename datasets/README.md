## How to contribute
We really welcome datasets from existing papers, and we are collecting the ones we find available on the web. If you have some models related to a published paper you have two ways to contribute:
1) raise an [issue](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/HexaLab/issues) asking for a dataset/paper to be included providing doi of the paper and the link to the dataset;
2) add it by yourself: clone the repo, add a folder as named as your paper with all the needed `.mesh` models, add an entry in the `index.json` file with all the needed info (title, authors, list of models, etc), and finally raise a pull request.
